This Python package is a powerful tool designed for lab staff and researchers in cancer with a programming background. With cancer being the leading cause of death in the Western world, this package aims to aid researchers in their mission to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients.

The package is specifically tailored for analyzing various data sets containing cancer cells from sources such as breast cancer and melanoma, which were treated with different drugs as monotherapies. By analyzing these data sets, the package is able to provide valuable information to help diagnose the unique condition of a patient's tumor and match them with a personalized drug cocktail.

The Python package is user-friendly and provides a wide range of analytical tools to assist researchers in their data analysis, including data preprocessing, statistical analyses etc. With its robust capabilities, the package has the potential to revolutionize the field of cancer research and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

This package is part of our final project, which was conducted in association with Professor Natay K. Balasha from the Hebrew University. The project was supervised by Dr. Noa Cohen.

Below is a poster about the project.
